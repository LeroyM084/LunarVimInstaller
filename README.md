# LunarVimInstaller 
LunarVimInstaller is a mini shell script that allows you to have a clean and easy NeoVim installation, and to sipply configure it with LunarVIM. 
It starts by desinstalling NeoVim and LunarVim if they're already installed, and then to reinstall them.

##Install 
Clone this repo 

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/LeroyM084/LunarVimInstaller.git
  cd LunarVimInstaller
  ```

You may need to make the script executable, if so, run this command : 

  ```bash
  chmod +x install.sh
  ```

Then you can simply run it by running this command : 

  ```bash
  ./install.sh
  ```

# Usage 
You can now open any text file with NeoVim by running this command : 

  ```bash
  nvim exemple.py
  ```

You can now admire your LunarVim configuration !
